INSTALLATION
============
1) Install the following gems:
    gem install right_aws
    gem install haml
    gem install RRDTool
2) Install the gems for whatever database you plan on using, e.g. sqlite3. Note: use of sqlite3 in production is strongly discouraged.
    gem install sqlite3-ruby
3) Edit your database configuration to your liking.
    (edit config/database.yml)
4) Create heymon's databases
    rake db:migrate
5) Edit `config/environment.rb` to point to your collectd installation.  Note: yes, the implication is that heymon must run on the same machine as collectd.
    COLLECTD_HOME = '<path to collectd installation>' # (edit config/environment.rb to change the following line)
6) Start rails and you're off!
